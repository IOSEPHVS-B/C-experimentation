# tiny C experiments

A collection of small C experiments.

### 0 template

Simple template, does nothing.



### 1 grid

A simple grid of squares with RGB values forming a gradient.



### 2 particles

A pravity simulation which uses a simple function to attract particles when far apart, and repel when close together, similar to the strong nuclear force. Particles come in different colours, each colour having different interactions with other colours. Funny emergent behaviour.



### 3 polygons

A simple alorithm for finting out if a point is within an n-sided polygon.



### 4 newton

A 2D newtonian planet simulation.



### 5 newton3D

Similar to newton but in three dimensions. Camera follows the midpoint of all the planets.



### 6 graphing

A simple 2D function graphing algorithm.
